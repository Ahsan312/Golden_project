# Golden_project
his repository includes two Python projects: a Plagiarism Checker that compares documents using NLP tools like NLTK or spaCy, and a Voice Assistant using speech recognition (SpeechRecognition) and text-to-speech libraries (gTTS or pyttsx3).

For the Plagiarism Checker project, you can use the following libraries:

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stemming, and parsing.
spaCy: A more efficient library for large-scale natural language processing, useful for document comparison.
For the Voice Assistant project:

SpeechRecognition: To convert spoken language into text.
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): For converting text to speech.
pyttsx3: Another text-to-speech conversion library that works offline.
